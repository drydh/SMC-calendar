General workflow for calendar:

1a) Add calendar entries to Polopoly
 * Entries from e-mails to kalendarium@math-stockholm.se.
 * Possibly entries from SU calendar (math.su.se) or general SU-emails (e.g., bachelor/master theses presentations,
   docent lectures, ...) that would be suitable for the calendar.
 * Add entrier either just before sending out the email or during the week.
 * Some seminar organizers add entries directly into Polopoly themselves.
 * Polopoly URL: https://www-edit.sys.kth.se/polopoly/CM
 * Polopoly location of calendar: Externa sajter -> Stockholms Matematikcentrum -> Calendar
 * Also see 3_polopoly.txt for more information.

1b) Add calendar entries to Polopoly from Mittag-Leffler (mittag-leffler.sh & ML-ads.py)
 * ML-ads.py broken since June 2023 (new webpage layout).

2) Add/remove subscriptions to emails.txt
 * Requests come to kalendarium@math-stockholm.se.
 * Lines starting with # are ignored.

3) Generate the calendar email (semads.py)
4) Possibly do minor edits
  * Potential problem: multi-day conferences
  * PhD defenses without lecturer in title (script semads.py could be improved to include this)
5) Send the calendar email (seminarmailer.py)

Bash script calendar.sh facilitates steps 3-5. See 2_usage.txt.
